 # Book Library

## Description:

 Develop a book library application where users can search for books and view details using a books API.

## Requirements:
- Fetch book data from a **public books API (e.g., Google Books API)**. 
- Display a list of books based on **user search queries**, **including book covers**, **titles**, and **authors**. 
- Allow users to **click on a book to view more details**, such as description and publication date. 
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for **responsive design**. 
- Deploy the application on a platform like **Netlify** or **Vercel**.

### I chose this project because iâ€™m a books lover  and i always wanted to develop an app to download free books.
